Algorithms based on subregular hypothesis for induction of phonological grammars and sets of underlying forms from morphophonological paradigms. (In progress.)

The Simplex Input Strictly 2-Local Decomposition Learning Algorithm of [Hua & Jardine 2021](https://github.com/rucll/ur_learning/blob/main/papers/huajardine2021si2dla.pdf) is implemented in `si2dla.py`.

Experimental versions of the algorithm are in `experimental.py`. 

The file `testing.py` contains some test data sets; this can be run from the command line to see how the algorithms perform.
